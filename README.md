This project presents a deep learning-based solution for automated flower classification using MobileNet, a lightweight convolutional neural network optimized for mobile and embedded devices. The system classifies flower images into 102 distinct categories from the Oxford 102 Flower Dataset. It incorporates a web-based interface that allows users to upload flower images and receive accurate predictions along with fun facts and links to learn more about the flower.
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with subtle animations to enhance user experience. The backend is developed using Flask and TensorFlow, leveraging a fine-tuned MobileNet model. The project demonstrates the effective use of lightweight CNN models for real-time image classification, even in resource-constrained environments.
1.	To build a deep learning model using MobileNet for efficient and accurate flower recognition.
2.	To train the model on the Oxford 102 Flower Dataset and fine-tune it for high performance.
3.	To create an engaging, user-friendly web interface for uploading and classifying flower images.
4.	To enrich the user experience with flower facts, animated visuals, and learning resources.
5.	To ensure the system works smoothly on devices with limited computational power.
Technolgies used:
1.	Python 3.x: Core language for model training and backend
2.	TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework for training and inference
3.	MobileNetV2: Lightweight CNN model optimized for mobile and real-time use
4.	Oxford 102 Flower Dataset: Diverse dataset with labeled flower images
5.	Flask: Micro web framework for serving the model
6.	HTML/CSS/JS: For a responsive, animated frontend
7.	Jinja2: Template engine for rendering Flask views dynamically

This project is a compelling demonstration of how cutting-edge AI can be transformed into an experience that is simple, beautiful, and universally accessible. By thoughtfully combining a fine-tuned MobileNet model with a modern, interactive web interface, we've developed a system that does more than just recognize flowers—it inspires curiosity, delivers knowledge, and creates joy.
At its core, our solution leverages the efficiency and power of MobileNet, a lightweight neural network architecture optimized for mobile and edge devices. Through transfer learning and fine-tuning on a carefully curated dataset of 102 flower species, we achieved a high level of classification accuracy while maintaining fast inference times. This allows users to receive real-time predictions with minimal latency, regardless of device capability.
However, what sets this project apart is not just its technical proficiency, but its commitment to user experience and educational value. The interactive frontend is designed to be welcoming and intuitive for users of all ages and backgrounds. Key features—such as a typewriter-style flower name reveal, randomly generated botanical facts, direct links to Google searches, and a soothing falling petals animation—work together to transform a simple image upload into a multi-sensory, enriching interaction with AI.
This thoughtful design makes the application versatile and impactful across various settings:
1.	In classrooms, it can serve as a fun and educational tool for students learning about plant biology.
2.	In nature parks and botanical gardens, it can be a companion for visitors, enhancing their appreciation of local flora.
3.	On personal devices, it becomes a digital flower guide for hobbyists, gardeners, or anyone who loves nature.
By making advanced image recognition technology both approachable and delightful, we demonstrate how AI can bridge the gap between complexity and accessibility. Whether you're a botany student, a curious child, or simply a flower enthusiast, this app offers a meaningful, memorable way to interact with artificial intelligence—not as a cold tool, but as a companion in discovery.
In a world increasingly driven by technology, this project is a reminder that innovation is at its best when it empowers, educates, and connects. With its lightweight architecture and responsive design, this flower recognition app is ready to be deployed anywhere—bringing intelligent, nature-inspired interaction to the palms of users around the world.
