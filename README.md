This project presents a **deep learning-based solution for automated flower classification** using **MobileNet**, a lightweight convolutional neural network optimized for mobile and embedded devices.  

The system classifies flower images into **102 categories** from the **Oxford 102 Flower Dataset** and features a **web-based interface** that allows users to upload images and receive:  
- Accurate predictions  
- Fun facts about flowers  
- Links to learn more about each species
